      "abstract": "The use of SAT-based model finding for specification analysis is a crucial characteristic of Alloy , and a main reason of its success as a language for software specification. When a property of a specification is analyzed and deemed satisfiable, the user usually explores instances of the corresponding satisfiability, in order to understand the analysis outcome. The order in which instances are obtained during exploration can impact the efficiency and effectiveness with which specification analysis is carried out. This has been observed by various researchers, and different instance exploration strategies have been proposed, besides the standard SAT-solver driven strategy implemented with the Alloy Analyzer . In this paper, we concentrate on a strategy recently proposed in the literature, that we refer to as “field-value” driven, and has been implemented in the tool HawkEye . The tool allows the user to interactively guide instance exploration, by enforcing constraints requiring fields to contain (resp., do not contain) specific values. We design an experiment involving faulty Alloy specifications featuring combinations of over constraints and under constraints, and perform a user study to analyze the impact of this instance exploration strategy, in comparison with the standard SAT-solver driven exploration. The study focuses on HawkEye ’s facility of interactive instance querying and how it may favor users, in its current realization, during Alloy model analysis and debugging. We perform an assessment of the evaluation, and summarize some of the reasons that may diminish the impact of field-value exploration in model finding.",
